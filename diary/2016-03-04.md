# Universal Portal Webservice API
## Web app code
### multiple mapped humans
```brush: perl
package AthenaX::PatientPortal::WebApp::Health;
sub route {
	'/problems' => { action => 'display_problems' },
}
sub display_problems {
	my $self = shift;
	$self->show_whiskers('product:/health/problems',
		$self->remote_request_for_human({
			type => 'GetProblems',
			# ONE OF
			current_human => 1,
			# OR
			all_humans => 1,
			# OR
			human_ids => ['a498fjv', '898arfcja'],
			# OPTIONAL
			aggregator => {
				subsystem => 'Chart',
				function => 'AggregateProblems',
			},
		});
	);
}
```
### single request
```brush: perl
package AthenaX::PatientPortal::WebApp::AppointmentShopping;
sub route {
	'/appointment_search' => { action => 'appt_data' },
}
sub appt_data {
	my $self = shift;
	$self->add_to_output(EncodeJSON(
		$self->remote_request({
			type => 'GetAppointmentsByLocation',
			source => { CLASS => 'GlobalScheduling' },
			args => {
				ZIP => $self->request_params->{ZIP},
				TIME => $self->request_params->{TIME},
			},
		});
	);
}
```

## underlying webapp code
### multiple mapped humans
```brush: perl
sub remote_request_for_human {
	my ($self, $args) = @_;
	my @humans = $self->get_humans_from_session($args);
	$self->subsystem('PatientIdentity')->RemoteRequest({
		TYPE => $args->{type},
		UNIVERSALPORTALUSERID => $self->user_session->user_id,  # maybe null
		ARGS_FOR_REQUESTS => [ @humans ],
		AGGREGATOR => $args->{aggregator},
	});
}
```
### single request
```brush: perl
sub remote_request {
	my ($self, $args) = @_;
	$self->subsystem('PatientIdentity')->RemoteRequest({
		TYPE => $args->{type},
		UNIVERSALPORTALUSERID => $self->user_session->user_id,  # maybe null
		ARGS_FOR_REQUESTS => [{
			SOURCE => $args->{source},
			%${ $args->{args} },
		}],
	});
}
```
## dispatcher code
```brush: perl
package Athena::PatientIdentity::API::UniversalPortal;

#Universal portal check-in

* What is MVP?
	* Make that determination soon - MP
	* Then we'll get a 'waterfall' delivery plan
	* This shouldn't change what we're focues on
* ARB report out
	* We're going to have 3 ARB meetings, at least
	* Biweekly
	* Take away: security model should be built directly on an implemented security model
	* We should be building aggregation logic in subject-area subsystems
	* No clarity on schema/infrastructure
	* Systems: we need to develop a point of view on both sync/async transport layers
* Meds design
* Org
	* Confluence: everything under "Universal Portal Official"
	* "Universal Portal (OLD)" is the old homepage
* Status updates
	* Invite workflow - totally blocked on systems questions
	* Systems - totally blocked on systems questions
		* ID and systems need to strategize on how to move forward
	* Prospective: just did research, readout next week
* Framworks
	* Slowing
	* Blocked by ARB maybe
	* Getting more familiar with Foundation/SASS for media queries and stuff
	* There isn't enough concrete work to do
	* What about 'Find provider' flow?
	* Colin's been experimenting with Backbone, wants to test some more frameworks
		* Timing: don't know when we need to get it down
		* Want to stucture code such that multiple frontend toolkits could be used
		* How does that work?
* MPI update
	* Their APIs are likely not to be performant since they won't have an MPI ID
	* Don't know if Adam's involved in chasing that down
