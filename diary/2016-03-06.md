# Universal portal authorization work

I just realized, unfortunately, that OAuth probably completely satisfies our security needs for the patient portal with the following behavior:
* PingFederate acts as the authorization server
* Authentication is entirely handled by the pingfederate server, which then grants the universal portal and authorization grant to the universal portal which represents a limited access to all of the mapped patients for the universal portal
* Upon each resource request, athenaNet checks with PingFederate to inquire about the authorization status of the request.
* UP doesn't handle any authentication logic and contains no mapping data
* athenaNet mapping data is written back to the universal portal by some backend process, SCIM seems probable.

Ugh.

Issues:
* Can PingFederate scale to handle requests from buttloads of athenaNet instances all at the same time?
* Can PingFederate scale to manage permissions and mappings for the patient population of the US?
	* Ping seems designed for enterprise (thousands of users) rather than web service (millions of users)
* Is dealing with PingFed, and potentially ratting out limitations in it, worth it, or can we design something that's secure and scalable?
* When expanding to separate partners, when we start talking proper OAuth or some other auth protocol, would a home-grown solution (maybe even home-grown protocol) be a liability?
