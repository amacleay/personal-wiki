# DockerCon17 & UPI

___

## What is UPX?

* A set of patient-facing web-applications <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * ... with a common deployment scheme and software stack <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    * nodejs
    * docker
* Didn't you just talk about this yesterday? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

___

## What is UPI?

* Part of Patient Network Services <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Working at the seams <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Charter: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->**Deploy** 
  * Work with IaaS, devops, RPR, AppFabric, UPX, and other Platform 2.0 application teams
  * Identify blockers for UPX and try to remove them

___

## Containers

* <span class="fragment">Not really </span>just a smaller VM
* Namespaces <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* cgroups <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## namespaces

Namespaces -- Linux feature for process isolation

* Sits in front of much of the syscall interface <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Multiple types: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * process `NEWPID`
  * hostname `NEWUTS`
  * inter-process communication `NEWIPC`
  * ipv4, ipv6, routing tables, firewall, sockets `NEWNET`
  * mount `NEWNS`
*  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->`ls -al /proc/<PID>/ns` (note: I can't really read this myself)
*  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->`nsenter -u -p -m`

<aside class="notes">
Note:

Demo nsenter?
<br>

<pre>

docker run alpine yes
nsenter -t $( pidof yes ) hostname
sudo nsenter -t $( pidof yes ) -u hostname
# compare to docker ps

nsenter -t $( pidof yes ) ps
sudo nsenter -t $( pidof yes ) -m -p ps
</pre>

## cgroups

`cgroups` (control groups) - Linux feature for process limits

* Since kernel 2.6.24 in 200 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Controls multiple types of resource allocation:
  * CPU utilization
  * disk I/O
  * Memory
  * Filesystem cache
  * Allocated process IDs

Note:
Demo: fork bomb

```
docker run -it --pids-limit 200 --name bomb alpine sh
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/pids/docker/$( docker inspect --format '{{.Id}}' bomb )/pids.max

docker stats
sleep 5; x(){ x | x & }; x

```

## What do containers help solve?

* Elastic horizontal scaling <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Underutilization <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Improve performance on distributed workloads (with caveat) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Dependency hell <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Caveat:
* docker cs 1.12.3, vmware, commodity hardware
with sysbench to test capacity

8 VMs w/ 1 workload compared to 1 VM w/ 8 containers: increase utilization by 25%, 30% less storage, 7% less RAM

8VMs 1 workload each compared to 8 containers bare metal: increase utilization by 47%

They needed to tune: CPU pinning etc.  Without tuning, performance was _worse_

___

## What don't containers help solve?

* Persistent storage<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Logging<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Monitoring<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Service discovery <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Insight into running services<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Resource starvation (eg PID, port exhaustion)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Secret management/security <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
In fact, containerization probably makes all of these things much harder

## Insights from enterprises

Containerization is catching on with enterprise companies<span class="fragment">... very slowly</span>

* MetLife, Intuit, Visa <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Success stories, but all still essentially in trial mode <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Small, cross functional teams with extremely narrow business objectives and nearly zero bureaucratic overhead were successful <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Close relationships with vendors (Docker, Amazon, etc) absolutely critical <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Governance issues in relationship between development and operations is revolutionized, and really hard <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
MetLife did the most revolutionary change, but still very focused.

Visa in particular threw out their whole initial infrastructure as Docker Swarm began to meet their needs.  Had rolled their own scheduler.
