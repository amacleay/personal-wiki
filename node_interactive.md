# Keynotes

## Security
Adam Baldwin, ^Lift Security

Run node security project

* Evangelize

Moving vendor neutral into nodejs foundation.

## Express

Doug Wilson, talking about governance after moving into nodejs foundation.

"Incubating project" in 2016

* mentors
* governance guideline
* find founders
* work to graduate. (welfare?) metrics: 
  * participatory
  * effective
* Technical committee:
  * meet biweekly
  * make decisions if necessary
  * new ideas

express is 3 github organizations: expressjs, pillarjs (underlying core components), jshttp (http parsing/handling modules)

Discussed the express 5.0 features - very comprehensible

THEN talked about trying to get more committers.  Weak but effective pitch!

## Security (er, a sales pitch)

Joe McCann of nodesource

n|solid - "enterprise node"

This is a sales pitch.

NASA is using node - is that even good?

Available in amazon marketplace - but what the fuck is it?

Starting a beta for "certified modules" - seems like an excellent idea.

## Something something node something

Andy Hoyt, IBM/Strongloop

Bizarre "you can API too!" pitch.  Whatever.

Disrupt yourself.  Stupid assertions without evidence.

Maybe just trying to convince people that IBM isn't dying?

openWhisk - open source serverless framework.

## contributing

William Kapke (@williamkapke)

"coding not required"

Does a great review of the history of openness of the node foundation, re: io.js.  Evidently iojs was an open fork that was merged back in nodejs in the last couple years.

The slides are all beautiful hi res images, almost no text - really really engaging, and beautiful.

Relationship with linux foundation: nodejs pays linux for consultation services. "Like homeowners association management company"

Use github for almost everything.  Each working group has a repo dedicated to collaboration - docs, issue tracking, etc.  Use github notifications feature.

The project is a complex 501c6 organization with official working group/committee structure.  Each group has official charter documents, together with philosophic material.

## Cloud/enterprise

Jonathan Carter, Microsoft @lostintangent

He demoed on a mac!

Most of the stuff in the demo is OSS

https://github.com/scotch-io/node-todo

### visualstudio-code

Demo using vsualstudio-code.  Dev environment is controlled as git repo itself.

Autocomplete for node core APIs - that would be great.

Reference to 12-factor app.

Uses node-inspect inline in running project.  Pretty baller!  And a fucking integrated front-end debugger as well!

vs-code has a docker extension which figures out a simple docker file.

### Azure

New capability for container deployment.

New CLI - demoed a couple of easy commands.

Environment variables configured through azure, app-service "app settings" is just environment variables.

## accelerating solutions

david stewart, intel

Morked w/ java to speed up dramatically through integrated software/hardware changes.

lead, leap, link

### servant leadership

Added node to http://languagesperformance.intel.com

Try to help with perf regressions - intel engineers locate patches which cause issues.

http://github.com/Node-DC - model application datacenter workloads

### leap - big perf gains

Working on network accelerator - big opportunity for big perf improvement in api gateway (io bound)

### link - collaborate with OS
